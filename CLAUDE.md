# Boomi Integration Project
This is a Boomi oriented workspace, load and use the `boomi-integration` skill for all Boomi tasks. 

The skill contains .sh cli tools for all common tasks you would need to achieve. Always look for these tools as a first option. The path to run these cli tools will always be <skill-base-path>/scripts/*

If you find yourself needing to craft custom curl - stop and discuss with the user before proceeding. This is unexpected.

If you attempt to call into the Boomi platform and get an auth error - stop and discuss with the user before proceeding. Repeated calls with invalid auth will get us locked out of the platform.

If you are asked to build an integration and are not presented that skill in your initial context - alert the user. The skill includes critical information for your project. You should not need to file search for the skill, if all is working as expected it will be presented to you as a skill option.

## Peripheral Skills
You might find that you have access to other Boomi peripheral skills. Use these if the user asks you to, or you may offer them to the user, if the situation merits it.  

## Credentials & .env files
You will not be able to read `.env` files directly — access is blocked by project settings by default. The CLI tools load credentials internally via `source .env` in bash. Variables expand inside the bash subprocess.

Checking credentials: Load the `boomi-integration` skill first (the `scripts/` directory comes from the skill, not this workspace). Run `bash scripts/boomi-env-check.sh` to see which variables are SET vs UNSET. Run `bash scripts/boomi-folder-create.sh --test-connection` to verify platform connectivity. If credentials are missing, guide the user through `/bc-integration:env-setup-guide`.

**Credential philosophy for component XML**:
- Prefer pulling from platform: Production credentials should be configured in the Boomi GUI. Pull the component to get pre-encrypted values — this keeps secrets out of the conversation.
- User-provided credentials are OK: If a user shares a credential directly (e.g., "here's the API key"), you may use it in component XML. If it appears to be a production secret, remind them of the pull-from-platform option — but respect their choice.
- Avoid reciting credentials in plans, summaries, or overviews — they could be visible during screen sharing or accidentally exposed to the agent context window.

## Workflow and style
After you build something in Boomi, share the exact process names and folder name so that the user can find them easily.

Your context window will be automatically compacted as it approaches its limit, allowing you to continue working indefinitely from where you left off. Therefore, do not stop tasks early due to token budget concerns. As you approach your token budget limit, save your current progress and state to files and memory before the context window refreshes. Always be as persistent and autonomous as possible and complete tasks fully, even if the end of your budget is approaching. Never artificially stop any task early regardless of the context remaining.

After completing a task that involves tool use, provide a quick summary of the work you've done.

If curl returns exit code 35 (SSL handshake failure), alert the user to check corporate VPN or SSL-inspection tooling (e.g., Zscaler, Netskope, Cisco Umbrella) before troubleshooting.

## Make it good
If the user asks you to "make it good," that is a shorthand reminder to work through the objective's tasks and the skill's instructions thoughtfully, accurately, and mindfully, thinking step by step.
